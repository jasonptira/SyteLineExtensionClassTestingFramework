## Getting the .dll files

If you need to get the .dll files, you can enter a form in edit mode, then in the top right in the properties section, there is a pencil icon to edit form script. If you select the drop down next to it, you can download the solution file as a .zip. This will contain a folder with the needed DLL files.
